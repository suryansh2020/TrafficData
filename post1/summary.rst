Descriptive Statistics
======================

How fast does traffic move on the highway throughout the day?

Data for real time traffic monitoring is located at <a href="http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/DevelopersData.aspx">massdot developer data</a>. In this post, we're interested in how traffic has behaved over time. We want to know descriptive statistics on the speed of traffic.

MassDOT has kindly provided Real Time Travel Times for sections of I-93, I-90
and Route 3 in Massachusetts. That data can be accesssed in a more or less easy
fashion on <a href="https://github.com/hackreduce/MassDOThack/tree/master/Road_RTTM_Volume">github</a>.
